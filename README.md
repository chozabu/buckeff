## _That game where you control a blob a bit like gish_

Video: http://chozabu.net/autopush/rollin-2016-10-22.flv

Currently this is just a play around with unreal engine, making a player a little similar to gish (but particles instead of springs)

Currently implemented is motion, and changing the balls "cohesion"

Also, distant particles will be dropped, and touching a particle will collect it
